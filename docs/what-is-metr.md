# What is METR?

METR is a [system of systems](system-of-systems.md) that ensures digital rules and regulations are communicated dynamically across systems, infrastructure, and end users. Importantly, METR authenticates and secures these communications in real time. This facilitates interoperability that is trustworthy, safe and effective. As an international standard, METR has to be flexible enough to support a range of environments. As such, METR is built on the three-tiered model depicted below. This allows for further refinements at the regional (multi-national), national, and local levels to support a connected, interoperable, and safe global transportation ecosystem.

Based on this model, the ISO documents capture globally applicable principles and requirements for the trustworthy management and distribution of electronic traffic regulations. The regions are defined as geographic areas within which transport users generally expect to be able to seamlessly travel; these are typically multi-national areas. Each regional body is responsible for refining the global, high-level requirements to promote an interoperable environment within their region. For example, regional bodies will typically want to define policies and interface standards to facilitate data sharing; this might include identifying the cybersecurity scheme, data models, and protocols to be used; which often vary by region. At the national and local level, the details need to be tailored further; for example, identifying how the roles and responsibilities of the various actors defined within the METR standards are to be fulfilled by the various entities within the locality. 

## Terminology used on this website

This website uses the following conventions so the language stays searchable if the terms evolve again:

| Term | Meaning on this website |
| --- | --- |
| **rule** | Legislative provisions (for example, highway/road-code **rules of the road**) |
| **regulation** | Provisions established by a regulator, whether mandatory, advisory, or guidance |
| **rules and regulations** or **R&amp;Rs** | The combined set of both |

The ISO 24315 series title and the acronym **METR** remain **Management of Electronic Traffic Regulations**. That name does not change. In the text, METR is understood to apply to **rules and regulations (R&R)** — not only to regulator-issued regulations.

ISO 24315-1 Vocabulary still uses *rule* as a broader umbrella term in the published standard. Where this website’s prose differs for clarity, the [vocabulary](documentation/Vocab.md) pages retain the ISO wording and note the website convention.

## Scope of R&R covered by METR

**Rules and regulations (R&R)** related to using the surface transport infrastructure include:

- Virtually all types of R&R, including those:
    - Published in the highway code (rules)
    - Established by regulators as mandatory, advisory, or guidance regulations
    - Posted with signs
    - Marked on the roadway (i.e., pavement markings)
    - Indicated through other traffic control devices (e.g., gates)
- Virtually all modes of travel, including R&R for:
    - Motor vehicles (i.e., self-propelled road vehicles)
    - Non-motorized road vehicles (e.g., horse and buggy)
    - Vehicles that do not normally mix with motor vehicles (e.g., pedal cycles, e-scooters, public-area mobile robots)
    - Foot traffic
- Virtually all surface transport facilities, including R&R for the use of:
    - Roads
    - Auxiliary lanes (e.g., cycle lanes)
    - Footpaths
    - Pedestrian plazas
    - Indoor environments (e.g., for PMRs)

METR is intended to support virtually any rule or regulation that needs to be conveyed to virtually any transport user. The attached graphic depicts R&R for freight vehicles, ride sharing, kerbside usage, micromobility operations, vulnerable road users (VRUs), public transport usage, lane usage, public-area mobile robots (PMRs), and road works. This information and more needs to be conveyed to all transport user systems; sample user systems include nomadic devices, PMRs, driver support systems, and ADS-equipped vehicles.

As driving automation systems become more common, the importance of providing trustworthy regulations to the public is becoming more critical.

## Challenges Addressed by METR

### Trustworthiness

While many previous efforts have focused on information delivery, METR focuses more on the pipeline to ensure that it can deliver regulations in a trustworthy manner. At a very basic level, consider a navigation system that displays the speed limit to the driver. Most current generation systems rely upon GNSS information from the navigation unit coupled with a database of speed limits (stored either locally or in the cloud) to display the current sped limit to the driver. But this can result in inaccurate information as the data in the database ages (e.g., especially in the case of temporary road work speed limits).

Other implementations rely on video imaging technologies to read signage, but these are also subject to errors in missing obscured signs or improperly interpreting signs. These issues can result in systems displaying erroneous speed limits (and other regulations) to the driver, or worse, using them for automated driving (e.g., Level 3). The developers of these systems acknowledge their limitations and they claim that the information is only informative and the driver is still responsible for complying with the posted regulations, even when these errors occur. For a human driver, such errors could result in the driver being liable for violating what is actually posted in the field - but to improve road safety and to enable higher levels of automated driving (e.g., Level 4 and 5), a more trustworthy mechanism is required to deliver these regulations.

METR, as defined in the ISO 24315 series, aims to enhance trustworthiness by using robust cryptographic mechanisms, authentication, feedback loops through discrepancy reports, and other security controls that ensure trustworthiness among all METR users and data providers.

### Layered rules and regulations

**Rules and regulations (R&R)** are defined by multiple layers of government and different departments within each layer. For example, **rules** may be enacted in legislation (highway/road code), while **regulations** may be established by a regional (multi-national) government, national government, state or provincial government, county government, city government, and even more local entities (e.g., borough, subdivision, or property/campus owner). Further, each of these entities can authorize multiple representatives to issue regulations, often with specific scopes. The following are some typical examples of how authorities can be divided within each level:

- the legislative arm can retain the authority to define rules and any regulation it wishes
- traffic engineers define permanent regulations (e.g., stop signs, speed limits)
- road operators (e.g., operators of traffic management systems) implement specific types of regulations based on schedules and current conditions (e.g., dynamic speed limits, lane closures)
- maintenance personnel approve and implement temporary regulations in relation to road works
- law enforcement personnel implement specific types of regulations based on current conditions (e.g., road closures due to flooding)

Each of these entities potentially have their own distinct data entry system yet all of these R&R need to be digitized, stored in a secure manner, and made available for sharing with other systems in a standard format. The METR [reference architecture](ig/guides.md) allows for all of these entities to enter regulations into a common network.

### Location Referencing

Virtually all rules and regulations are specific to a defined location. The location can be a point (e.g., a stop sign), a linear extent (e.g., a speed limit), or an area (e.g., a pedestrian zone, city, or country). Precisely defining locations so that they can be properly interpreted by multiple systems over prolonged periods of time is a major challenge. This is complicated by the fact that virtually all regulations are legally defined base on the location of "features" (e.g., an intersection, a bus stop, a distance from another feature, a city, etc.) while computer systems rely heavily on geographic coordinate systems to define locations. Aligning different systems is a challenge by itself. METR allows for various levels of location referencing data quality with an indication of the quality provided within the data to allow systems to avoid invalid inferences.

### Varied User Needs

Transport users have different needs for each trip that they take. For example, different users can have different needs based on:

1. The type of vehicle being operated (e.g., passenger car, heavy goods, or public-area mobile robot)
2. The origin and destination of a trip (e.g., local trip vs. cross-country)
3. The way in which the information is being used (e.g., pre-trip planning, driver information for speed limits, Level 4 ADS)

Each user needs access to the relevant regulations in a trustworthy manner although the agencies who sign and issue these regulations generally group them in different ways. As a result, the issued regulations will typically need to be repackaged before distribution to the end user. The METR architecture allows for this repackaging while preserving a trust chain back to the originator of the regulation.

### Timeliness

Within its scope, METR will support both pre-announced regulations, which can be accessed well in advance of the location and time of need, and emergent regulations, which reflect recent changes in regulations (for example, due to flooding or other unplanned activities). Pre-announced regulations can easily be distributed via any number of internet technologies; the provision of emergent regulations can be more challenging given that they can be enacted with limited notice and impact vehicles that do not currently have internet connectivity.

### Regional Tailoring

The METR standards provide a framework for providing electronic regulations, but as an international standard, these standards are designed to be very flexible to accommodate the political, legal, and financial realities across the world. It is the responsibility of regional authorities to further guide deployments to develop a consistent environment within each region. Additional details are provided in the [regional body perspective](regional-body-perspective.md).
