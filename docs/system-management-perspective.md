# System Management Perspective

<div class="draft1-watermark" aria-hidden="true"></div>

Every METR component system is hosted by an entity that plans, develops, deploys, operates, and maintains it. This page will cover cross-cutting system-management responsibilities shared across regulation, distribution, consumer, and discrepancy-handling systems — including lifecycle management, security operations, auditing, and change control in a system-of-systems setting. More detailed rules for each component system will be provided in the respective component system pages:

- [Regulation system](regulation-system-perspective.md)
- [Distribution system](distribution-perspective.md)
- [Consumer system](consumer-perspective.md)
- [Discrepancy handling system](discrepancy-handling-perspective.md)

## Deployment considerations

Deploying a METR component system requires meeting several prerequisites to ensure successful implementation. These include 
1.	Establishing the necessary infrastructure: METR component systems require secure, reliable and safe operational environments, network connectivity, and secure data storage solutions. Each deployment will need to specift how the infrastructure will be provided.
2.	Scope and size: Each METR component system will need to be designed to handle the specific types of regulations and vehicles that will be supported. Understanding the target market and the types of users who will rely on the system component is critical, as it influences the system’s design and functionality.
3.	Outsourcing vs. in-house operations: Each METR system Assess how much of the METR component system will be managed in-house versus outsourced, considering factors such as cost, expertise, and control.
4.	Compatibility and interoperability: Each METR system component must be compatible with the existing METR component systems per the policies established by the regional body, including meeting minimal requirements for interoperability. Interoperability is a key factor in the success of a METR component  system. Minimal requirements include adherence to standardized data formats, protocols, and communication interfaces. 
5.	Auditing capabilities: Implementing robust auditing capabilities within each METR component system is crucial for maintaining its integrity and compliance. Audit systems allow inspection of the provenance and history of each electronic regulation, store evidence that transmissions were received by their intended recipients, and capture key interactions that can potentially identify security concerns. Effective auditing can ensure that the METR component system remains secure and trustworthy over time.
6.	Evolution of deployed component systems: As METR component systems are relatively new, particularly those outside of navigation providers, it is essential to plan for their evolution from the outset. This section discusses the need to design systems that can gracefully migrate between software versions and adapt to changing standards and requirements. By planning for evolution, operators can ensure that their METR component systems remain relevant and effective in the long term.
7.	Maintaining a deployed METR component system: Maintaining a METR component system involves both software and hardware upkeep. Regular updates to the system’s codebase are necessary to address security vulnerabilities, improve performance, and add new features. Hardware maintenance, including server upkeep, network management, and hardware replacements, is also required to ensure continuous and reliable operation. Operators should plan accordingly for routine maintenance activities, such as system monitoring, backups, and patch management, as well as occasional major upgrades that may be needed to support new METR standards ,  or functionalities, as well as new versions of existing METR standards.
8.	Cost Factors: While specific cost estimates are beyond the scope of this page, several cost factors must be considered during the deployment, operation, and maintenance of any METR component system:
1.	Connectivity Costs: Ensure reliable and secure connectivity for all system components, which is crucial for real-time regulation dissemination and compliance.
2.	Security Ecosystem: Invest in a comprehensive security framework to protect the integrity of the regulation system, including data encryption, access controls, and threat monitoring.
3.	Operation and Maintenance Costs: Budget for the ongoing costs associated with running the regulation system, including data storage, archiving, non-repudiation, and auditing.
4.	Information Entry Costs: Consider the costs of entering various categories of regulations into the system, with attention to the complexity and volume of data required for different regulation types.
5.	Impact on Maintenance, Construction, and Emergency Services: Plan for the operational impacts of emergent regulations on field personnel, particularly during critical periods such as construction or emergency response.
6.	Certification, Verification, and Compliance Costs: Allocate resources for the certification, verification, and ongoing compliance of regulations within the METR system.
7.	Personnel Training: Ensure that staff are adequately trained to manage and operate the METR system, including understanding the technical, legal, and operational aspects of electronic regulation management.

### Certificates, signing rights, and trust

Regulation trustworthiness depends on signing and certification practices. Jurisdictional managers should define:

- which roles may sign which regulation categories and confidence levels
- how signing keys and certificates are issued, stored, rotated, and revoked
- whether subordinate rule makers sign as themselves, or whether the parent jurisdiction countersigns or co-signs under defined policies
- how certificate status is published so distributors and consumer systems can validate signatures over time

Digital signatures should ideally indicate the entity legally responsible for the regulation, even when the regulation is hosted on a parent platform.

### Scope enforcement in the platform

Credentials are not enough by themselves. The hosted regulation system should enforce authorization in software and workflow:

- geographic and categorical limits for each rule maker
- rejection or quarantine of out-of-scope submissions
- mandatory metadata for confidence / certification level
- retention of who entered, verified, and signed each change

## Credentials and Security Management

Because hosted systems speak with legal and safety consequence, identity and cryptographic controls are central to jurisdictional management.

### User accounts and role separation

Within each recognized organization, separate duties such as:

- translation / data entry
- verification
- approval / signing
- administration (user and certificate management)
- read-only audit or oversight

Least privilege reduces the chance that a single compromised account can inject or alter signed regulations unnoticed.

### Operational security responsibilities

Ongoing duties typically include access reviews, key ceremony and HSM practices where used, logging and non-repudiation, incident response for credential compromise, and alignment with regional cybersecurity profiles. Auditing must preserve enough history to reconstruct what was published, by whom, under which authority, and when.

## Cost Factors

While specific cost estimates are beyond the scope of this page, several cost factors must be considered during the deployment, operation, and maintenance of a METR system:

1. **Connectivity Costs:** Ensure reliable and secure connectivity for all system components, which is crucial for real-time regulation dissemination and compliance.

2. **Security Ecosystem:** Invest in a comprehensive security framework to protect the integrity of the regulation system, including data encryption, access controls, and threat monitoring.

3. **Operation and Maintenance Costs:** Budget for the ongoing costs associated with running the regulation system, including data storage, archiving, non-repudiation, and auditing.

4. **Information Entry Costs:** Consider the costs of entering various categories of regulations into the system, with attention to the complexity and volume of data required for different regulation types.

5. **Impact on Maintenance, Construction, and Emergency Services:** Plan for the operational impacts of emergent regulations on field personnel, particularly during critical periods such as construction or emergency response.

6. **Certification, Verification, and Compliance Costs:** Allocate resources for the certification, verification, and ongoing compliance of regulations within the METR system.

7. **Personnel Training:** Ensure that staff are adequately trained to manage and operate the METR system, including understanding the technical, legal, and operational aspects of electronic regulation management.

## Auditing Capabilities

Implementing robust auditing capabilities within the METR system is crucial for maintaining its integrity and compliance. The policies for the system should define the audit trail for the system, including the ability to track changes, verify data accuracy, and identify potential issues before they become critical. Effective auditing can reduce the risk and cost of operating the system, ensuring that it remains secure and trustworthy over time.

## Evolution of Regulation Systems

As METR systems are relatively new, particularly outside of navigation providers, it is essential to plan for their evolution from the outset. The policies for the system should define the need to design systems that can gracefully migrate between software versions and adapt to changing standards and requirements. By planning for evolution, operators can ensure that their METR systems remain relevant and effective in the long term.

## Deployment Example with Project-Level Architecture

The documentation of the system should include system-level architecture that specifies the specific external systems to which it will connect. The ==example illustrates== how the reference architecture can be adapted to reflect the specific needs of a specific system while ensuring compatibility and interoperability with other systems.
